I still have a really big road ahead of me, I have so much to learn, but I hold really dear the project I did for my web design class last semester.

I'm sorry if I have too many mistakes in English, I'm doing my best!) I took several courses to become a style corrector. And second, even though I never studied it, I also know a little bit about design. I know how to use Photoshop, Illustrator, and mostly, InDesign (I used Illustrator to create my logo, hope you liked it!). So I am proud of working as a free-lance style corrector and designer for several mexican companies that produce books.
